# Git Push Instructions

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/chakradharkalle03-arch
2. Click "New repository" or go to https://github.com/new
3. Repository name: `MB-device-slots-recognize-multi-agent-system` (or any name you prefer)
4. Description: "Manufacturing SOP Automation System - Multi-Agent AI System for generating Standard Operating Procedures"
5. Choose Public or Private
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push to GitHub

After creating the repository, run these commands:

```bash
cd "C:\Users\user\Downloads\projects\MB_ device_slots_recognize_use_mutli_agent_system"

# Add remote (replace REPO_NAME with your actual repository name)
git remote add origin https://github.com/chakradharkalle03-arch/REPO_NAME.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Alternative: If you want to use a different repository name

Just replace `REPO_NAME` in the remote URL with your chosen name.
